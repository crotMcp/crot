# CROT — Status

Current snapshot of the v1 work. Per-work-package status, dependencies and
order are in [`CROT_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`](CROT_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md);
architecture and decisions in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md). Every work
package PR updates this file.

## Last completed

**WP-28 — Identity and device binding** (merged in crot-mcp PR #16,
`4d574f0`;
ARCHITECTURE.md §27 AD-21 with its implementation note). User docs:
[`docs/IDENTITY.md`](docs/IDENTITY.md), [`docs/TRAY.md`](docs/TRAY.md),
[`docs/SERVICE.md`](docs/SERVICE.md), README.

- **Verifier** (`src/identity/verifier.ts`) behind `AccessTokenVerifier` for
  the relay entry point, in the order of AD-21 point 3: RS256 with JWKS from
  the issuer's RFC 8414 metadata (bounded cache and refetch), `iss`, a single
  `aud` = the device's canonical URI, `exp` (no leeway) / `nbf` / `iat`
  (60 s skew, 15 min ceiling), `sub` = paired account, `client_id`. Only
  verified facts reach `AuthInfo`; `authMethod: "oauth"` is accepted only on
  the relay entry point, the local token never there. 401s carry
  `WWW-Authenticate` with the device's PRM URL.
- **Device binding** (`src/service/device-binding.ts`): paired account,
  device id (16 random bytes, base32), environment; Ed25519 device key in
  the secret store (`device-key`); protected private state, fail closed; a
  new device id and key per pairing; tunnel credential (domain-separated
  challenge signature) only for a paired device in its environment.
- **Pairing** (`src/identity/pairing.ts`): authorization code + PKCE S256,
  loopback redirect, `resource` = the new device's canonical URI; the token
  is verified like a remote request's, `sub` becomes the account; audited
  first; tray "Pair this device" opens the sign-in in the browser.
- **Revocation:** unpair (immediate, ends requests in flight, removes the
  key); re-grant of a revoked client (audited first, persisted before
  effect, older tokens refused); admission also checks the binding.
  Provider-side revocation from the tray is a hook reporting "not
  available" until WP-36.
- **Environment:** no release environment is pinned (WP-38/WP-39); a
  development environment comes from `CROT_IDENTITY_DEV_ENVIRONMENT`, which
  every build honours until one is pinned (release-gate item, roadmap §2.6
  N3).
- **Review** (independent review of PR #16 against AD-15, AD-21 and the
  WP-28 card): re-grant now takes effect inside its queued write, so a
  background write cannot serialize the revoked state after it (hardening,
  with a regression test); tray "Cancel pairing" message cleaned up; docs
  list the assumptions not yet verified against live WorkOS, the re-pairing
  effect on revocations, and the provider-side revocation deferral (N3).

Tests: `tests/identity/` (verifier with real RS256 JWTs and JWKS rotation,
pairing over a real loopback callback, binding, credential, environment,
re-grant boundary) against an in-process emulated AuthKit environment
(`tests/identity/test-authorization-server.ts`); the WP-22 relay tests now
pair the device and use the real verifier (`tests/service/tray-control.test.ts`,
new WP-28 block covering the AD-21 point 8 device column), tray controller
and view model. No live WorkOS environment was available for this PR.

## Previously completed

**WP-23a — Linux command confinement L1** (ARCHITECTURE.md §27 AD-20,
decides the Linux part of OD-9 and OD-14; PR #6, `e1d1f61`). User docs:
[`docs/L1.md`](docs/L1.md), README. Follow-up CI test fixes after the merge:
PR #9 (`4df63c6`, Windows other-user probe without profile load), PR #11
(`2b803eb`, L1 renderer probe report race), PR #7 (`22abf89`, `git.write`
no-identity test with an isolated home); no production code changed.

- CROT-owned `crot-bwrap` (bubblewrap 0.11.0, pinned SHA-256) and
  `crot-l1-init` in `/usr/lib/crot/l1/<v>/`, AppArmor policy (ABI 3.0/4.0)
  installed and loaded by `scripts/l1-install.sh` (root; packaging WP-34);
  the service only verifies them.
- One sandbox per Core in workspace mode: read-only host, hidden protected
  paths and runtime directory (agent sockets bound back), writable workspace,
  private temp and home layer, network `on`/`off`, no nested user namespaces,
  process-tree cleanup.
- Docker endpoint on every transport (Unix, TCP, TLS, SSH, contexts) with
  checks a–d, HTTP 403, `confinement.docker_refused`, container profile for
  local daemons.
- `CONFINEMENT_UNAVAILABLE` (remote, before admission) and
  `CONFINEMENT_FAILED` (after admission, never retried unconfined); reason
  codes in `crot_status` and the tray.

- Home layer: directories the user owns with a supplementary group (e.g.
  `~/.docker`, group `docker`, on the GitHub runners) get a *group layer*
  (empty copies with the mapped uid/gid as a lower layer), because overlayfs
  cannot copy up an entry whose group is not mapped in the sandbox's user
  namespace (`EOVERFLOW`; `docker buildx` failed). Limitation: such *files*
  cannot be modified in place, only replaced ([`docs/L1.md`](docs/L1.md)).

Tests: real suites in the new L1 workflow (`.github/workflows/l1.yml`,
Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 x64/arm64, `CROT_L1_REQUIRED=1`), fixtures and mocks in
`tests/native-host/linux-l1/` and `tests/core/confinement.test.ts`. The L1
harness gives its remote scopes an in-memory (clean) exposure store, as the
Core unit tests do; without one every remote scope is exposed (fail closed)
and the untrusted-content gate refuses remote commands before L1 is reached.

Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 with Google Chrome: Ubuntu's `chrome` profile
(`flags=(unconfined)`, `userns,`) was added to the stack on exec, so Chrome
ran as `chrome//&crot-l1-<v>//&crot-l1-payload-<v>` and the L1 peer rules
denied its own IPC. Fixed: the installer adds exact-path `ix` rules for the
host's loaded unconfined userns profiles (`scripts/l1-host-exec.py`), and
the payload inherits its label on exec (`file rwlkmix`, as AD-20 states);
AD-20 point 3 carries the explicit amendment. The L1 workflow drives the
installed browser inside L1 over CDP and checks labels, denials and the
boundary of its process tree; on the arm64 runners there is no browser and
these checks are reported as not applicable (notice), not as passed.

Previous: **WP-22 — Tray v1 and approval provider on the control channel**
(PR #2, `4639392`; ARCHITECTURE.md §27 AD-19, decides roadmap OD-7). User docs:
[`docs/TRAY.md`](docs/TRAY.md), [`docs/SERVICE.md`](docs/SERVICE.md), README.

- **Tray.** Separate Electron app (`npm run tray`), only a client of the
  authenticated control channel: no MCP, no tools, no Core access. Sandboxed,
  context-isolated page from memory (`crot-tray://app/`, strict CSP,
  `textContent` only), fixed 4-function preload, IPC checked by origin and
  validated; navigation, new windows and permissions denied.
- **Approval provider.** Service-side provider `tray`, registered through a
  `CrotCore.create` composition option while a tray is subscribed; decisions
  only for presented, pending requests with the presented digest; no
  auto-decision, no "always allow". Presentation per approval-gates §6.3;
  page-supplied values flagged (`ApprovalEffect.flag: "page_supplied"`).
- **Preset (OD-7).** Device state in `service-settings.json`; applied by
  switching to a new Core only while idle (no operation, approval or
  background process); exposure and bridge carried over; `require-approval`
  and `off` selectable, `autonomous-browser` with WP-31; unreadable state →
  `require-approval`.
- **Remote controls.** Remote mode (off by default; relay entry point refuses
  before MCP/Core while off), full-control opt-in (recorded and audited only,
  no enforcement), remote client list `remote-clients.json`, per-client
  exposure reset and revocation (fail closed; aborts requests, closes
  sessions; no re-grant). Every change audited (`control` records); widening
  changes need their audit record first.
- **Status.** `overview` / `crot_status` show preset and source, remote
  switches, agents, browser, trays, and L1/CDP/pairing as not available.

Tests: `tests/tray/` (view model, controller against a real service, Electron
smoke test — runs under xvfb-run on Linux CI, skipped with a reason where
Electron cannot start, required on CI), `tests/service/tray-control.test.ts`,
`tests/service/control-center.test.ts`, updated core tests (browser approval,
approval gates, remote exposure reset) and HTTP relay admission.

Before: **WP-21 — Secret storage and child-process environment allowlist**
(PR #1, `881663b`; AD-18), **WP-20 — Supervised service, thin stdio
shim, local control channel** (mcp-crot PR #16, `92cce3b`; AD-17,
[`docs/SERVICE.md`](docs/SERVICE.md)).

## Next

**Next: the OD-4 decision (relay–device tunnel protocol, an AD), then WP-29 —
Cloud Relay v1** (roadmap §8.4). Critical path: yes — chain B continues
WP-29 → WP-30 → WP-31 → WP-32 → WP-33 → WP-40. WP-28 provides what WP-29
and WP-30 consume: verifier facts, device id, canonical URI and PRM URL,
the device credential (`CrotService.tunnelCredential()`).

| WP | What | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OD-4 → WP-29 | Tunnel protocol AD, then Cloud Relay v1 | next; WP-28 done; OD-3 decided (AD-21) |
| WP-24 | Browser v1: CDP backend, snapshot and references, trusted input, frames, shadow DOM, waiting, history (AD-16) | unblocked (WP-18), no open decision; parallel to OD-4/WP-29 |
| WP-23b/c | Command confinement L1 on macOS and Windows (Linux done: WP-23a, AD-20) | blocked by the macOS/Windows part of OD-9; WP-23c starts with its spike (OD-6); release-blocking (AD-13), needed before WP-31 |
| WP-35 | Extension publication, submitted early | preparation now; submission after WP-24…WP-26 (`debugger`, `downloads`, `tabGroups`) |
| WP-41, WP-42 | Extensibility invariant tests; workspace image view (post-v1 phase 5, no AD needed) | can start now with spare capacity; never displace the critical path |
| OD-15…OD-20, OD-23 | ADs of the expanded product goal (jobs, components, media, edit description, connectors, credentials; release staging) | documentation work, parallel to WP-29; see roadmap §4.2 |

**Expanded product goal (proposal, not implemented).** CROT is to become an
extensible execution environment for local and remote agents with full
media work, video editors and external services. Reassessment, decisions
and order: [`docs/plan/product-reassessment.md`](docs/plan/product-reassessment.md);
cards WP-41…WP-70: [`docs/plan/extension-work-packages.md`](docs/plan/extension-work-packages.md);
roadmap §2.7, §3, §4.2 (OD-15…OD-23), §8.5. v1 scope and the critical path
are unchanged; none of phases 5–8 is release-blocking (OD-23, recommended).
Nothing of it is implemented: media work today is only possible through
`shell.execute` (untested; remote on macOS/Windows refused without L1),
and no external service has a CROT integration.

## Open questions and follow-ups

| Item | Where it is decided |
| --- | --- |
| Full move of stdio and legacy sessions to MCP SDK v2 (today: v1 + v2 side by side) | follow-up after WP-19 |
| `server/discover` lists only 2026-07-28 (legacy versions are reachable via `initialize`) | follow-up / WP-32 |
| Concurrency limit for the tunnel entry point (loopback has `http.maxConcurrentRequests` since WP-20) | WP-30 |
| Background processes are owned by the service, not by the stdio client that started them (shared by all clients; they outlive that client until the service stops) | follow-up (AD-17 scope) |
| Approval deadlines are not extended across system sleep; sleep detection is a clock-jump heuristic (not changed by WP-22) | follow-up |
| All stdio clients of a user share one configuration and one process environment (supervisor's or starting shim's; differing PATH/shell/home is reported to the client; commands get only the allowlisted part since WP-21) | AD-17 residual risk; WP-34 |
| Windows named pipes keep Node's default security descriptor (no explicit owner-only DACL) | WP-34 |
| Unconfined children can use the OS secret store (or the file fallback) as the same user | AD-18 residual risk; Linux workspace mode: closed by WP-23a; `full_control`, macOS, Windows: open (WP-23b/c) |
| Host-local services that accept the user's authority without a CROT credential (Docker on TCP without TLS, SSH server on this host accepting the user's keys, debugging/notebook endpoints without authentication, container engines without the CROT container profile) are reachable with network `on` | Accepted residual risk of the host-network model (AD-20 point 14, OD-14 decided); reported in `detail` where detectable; disclosure in WP-37 |
| macOS, Windows and browser parts of the v1 platform matrix | roadmap OD-9 (Linux part decided by AD-20); blocks WP-23b/c and WP-34 |
| L1 components on user machines (installing `crot-bwrap`, `crot-l1-init`, the AppArmor policy and host exec rules; `scripts/l1-install.sh` until then) | WP-34 |
| AD-18/AD-19 texts still say "until L1 (WP-23)" although Linux is confined since AD-20 | roadmap §2.6 N1 (not amended silently) |
| `secrets.store: "auto"` keeps the file fallback once chosen; switching needs `"os"` | AD-18 residual risk |
| Autostart registration (systemd user unit, LaunchAgent, Task Scheduler) | WP-34 |
| Revoking a client's authorization at the identity provider from the tray (best effort after the device-side revocation; hook exists, reports "not available") | WP-36 (CROT account service holds the provider credentials) |
| No live WorkOS environment exercised yet (tests use an emulated AuthKit environment; unverified assumptions listed in docs/IDENTITY.md); no release configuration pins an identity environment, so every build honours the development override until then | WP-38 (staging), WP-39 (production), WP-34 (ship only pinned builds); release-gate item, roadmap §2.6 N3 |
| Relay–device tunnel protocol that uses the device credential (challenge signature format fixed by WP-28) | OD-4 (AD before WP-29), WP-29, WP-30 |
| Remote full-control opt-in is recorded only; how it takes effect (per-principal profile; `principalKinds` exists only in approval rules) | AD-19 point 7; WP-31 |
| Preset `autonomous-browser` (rule set not implemented yet) | WP-31 |
| Any process of the same OS user can read the control credential and act like the tray | AD-19 residual risk; confined Linux children: closed by WP-23a; macOS, Windows, `full_control` and other processes of the user: open (WP-23b/c) |
| Tray packaging, signing and autostart (Electron is a dev dependency today) | WP-34 |
| Identity provider and the token claims carrying the subject, account, device and `clientId` | Decided by ARCHITECTURE.md §27 AD-21 (roadmap OD-2): WorkOS AuthKit; `sub` → principal id and `accountId`, device id in `aud`, `client_id` → `clientId`; implemented on the device by WP-28 |
| Exact device resource URI form and PRM location | Decided by AD-21 points 5–6 (roadmap OD-3): `https://<relay-host>/d/<deviceId>/mcp`, PRM at `https://<relay-host>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/d/<deviceId>/mcp` (relay: WP-29) |
| RFC 9207 (`iss` in authorization responses) not provided by the selected provider yet | **Still open** — AD-21 open condition: met before Gate G4 or accepted by a separate AD; WP-28 checks `iss` when present but neither requires nor claims it |
| Revocation at the identity provider reaches the device only through token expiry (≤ 5 min configured, ≤ 15 min device ceiling); device-side revocation is immediate | AD-21 point 4 (accepted bound) |
| Extensibility beyond v1 (media, video editors, external services, jobs, optional components) | Audit revision 2: [`docs/design/extensibility-audit.md`](docs/design/extensibility-audit.md); open decisions OD-15…OD-23 (roadmap §4.2, ARCHITECTURE.md §26 questions 16–24) |
| GUI control of desktop applications ("never in scope: OS-level input") | unchanged for v1; reassessed by OD-22 after spike WP-69 |
| Vendor API facts (YouTube, ElevenLabs, TikTok, Canva) | unverified; confirmed by WP-60, WP-62 and the first step of WP-58/WP-59 ([`docs/design/integration-map.md`](docs/design/integration-map.md)) |
| Transport matcher to gate loopback HTTP separately from stdio | ARCHITECTURE.md §26 question 12 (not required for v1) |
| Relay/tunnel timeouts for gated requests and bounded browser waits | §26 question 13, WP-29 / WP-30 |
| Approval policy in general (beyond presets) | §26 question 6 |
| Limit remote agents to tabs they opened | §26 question 14 (opened by AD-16; not required for v1) |
| Input into background tabs on real sites; validation on at least three real sites | WP-24 |
| Debugger notice in headed Chrome/Edge/Brave on all OS; enterprise policies blocking `chrome.debugger` | WP-25 |
| Download hand-over mechanism (staging in the download directory or stream over the bridge) | WP-26 |
| Store acceptance of the `debugger` permission | WP-35 |
| How a preset change is applied by the supervised service (reload or restart) | WP-31 |
